# SLAM

In school, we had a fascinating course called "Interval Analysis" that delved into the world of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). If you're interested, you can find the course's website [here](https://simon-rohou.fr/temp/codac/) and my GitHub repository for the course [here](???).

## What is SLAM?

SLAM, short for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, is a technique used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and submarines. Its purpose is to create a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the robot's location within it. To achieve this, the robot relies on sensors that provide information about the environment and its own movement. By leveraging this data, the robot constructs a map of the environment and determines its own position within it.

## How does SLAM work?

SLAM is a complex problem that involves multiple steps. First, the robot collects sensor data regarding the environment and its own movement. It then utilizes this data to build a map of the environment and accurately localize itself within it. This process is repeated continuously as the robot navigates through the environment. Additionally, the robot must account for uncertainties in the sensor data and its own movement, as well as the possibility of errors in the map it is constructing.

## Why is SLAM important?

SLAM plays a crucial role in robotics and autonomous systems as it enables robots to operate and navigate in unknown environments. By creating maps of their surroundings and accurately determining their position within those maps, robots can perform tasks such as exploration, search and rescue missions, and surveillance. SLAM is also utilized in applications like autonomous vehicles, drones, and underwater robots.

## Conclusion

SLAM is a powerful technique that empowers robots to construct maps of unfamiliar environments and accurately determine their position within those maps. It serves as a vital tool for robotics and autonomous systems, finding applications in various fields including exploration, search and rescue, and surveillance. Although SLAM is a complex problem with multiple steps, advancements in technology and algorithms are making it increasingly practical and effective. The field of SLAM is exciting and is expected to continue growing and evolving in the years to come.
